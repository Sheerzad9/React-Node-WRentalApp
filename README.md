<h1 align="center">The Dress Exchange <p>(project in very early stage)</p></h1>
<h3>Welcome to the Wedding Dress Rental Platform! This hobby project is designed to help me learn Next.js and various interesting libraries while building a platform for renting wedding dresses. The main idea is to create a platform where users can list their wedding dresses for rent, and interested individuals can easily find and rent them.</h3>

## Project Status

Currently, the project is in its initial development stage, and only the front page with login and register modal and logic is implemented. The register modal utilizes email verification for added security.

## Future Plans

- Development plans include enhancing the front page with additional features such as a footer, adding a product page, implementing a profile page where users can upload their profile pictures and list their wedding dresses for rent, integrating a chat feature for communication between buyers and renters, and integrating Stripe for payment processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React with Typescript
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- **CI/CD**: Continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines are handled in Vercel
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing will be done with Cypress

## Integration Plans

- **Payment Processing**: Integration with Stripe for payment processing.
- **Chat Feature**: Exploration of different options for integrating a chat feature for communication between users.
